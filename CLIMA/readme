===   Instructions to use the 1D climate model 
===   Developed by Dr. James Kasting, collegues and students.

The code is in fortran 77 with some fortran 90 features.

It is set to run in a cray system, because of that we didn't set double 
precision on it, in other systems the program may need to be configured to 
use double precision. For that you need to add the next line at the 
start of the  main program and all the subroutines:
        IMPLICIT DOUBLE PRECISION (A-H,O-Z)

The climate model can be used alone or loosley coupled with a photochemical
model. Instructions for this capability are in the readme file under the 
main directory.

The model is tunned to work coupled to the photochemical code, this means that
an Earth-like planet (atmosphere like present Earth) in the habitable 
zone of a star is going to have a surface temperature of 288K. If the program
is used by itself it needs to be tunned accordingly. 

The climate code is in the directory CLIMA which contains:

+ Clima.f
The main program of the climate model. A long comment at the start of the
program explains its capabilities and related publications.

+ make_clima 
Executable file to compile and generate the fortran executable file that runs 
the climate model. It automatically detects when the programs have been 
compiled. 

+ map.help
This file is a guide that has a list of the subroutines and common blocks
on each subroutine. 
 
+ IO/
Subdirectory with the input and output files

+ DATA/
Subdirectory with the data files that the program needs to run.

+ Subroutine subdirectories:
(Descriptions of the subroutines in the readme files within each 
subdirectory)
SETUP
CONVEC
RADTRANS
RRTM
COUPLE
PRTCL

+ CLIMA.o and RRTM.o
These subdirectories storage the *.o files that result from the compilation
of the code. 

***** To COMPILE and RUN the climate model

1. Choose the composition of the atmosphere in IO/mixing_ratios.dat
2. Choose the parameters to run the program in IO/input_clima.dat
3. Compile the climate typing:
	make -f make_clima
4. Run the model typing:
	./clima

To start from the last solution copy IO/TempOut.dat to IO/TempIn.dat

** To use COUPLED with the PHOTOCHEMICAL model
Follow steps 1 to 3 explained before then follow the instructions in the 
readme file located at the main directory PhotClim
