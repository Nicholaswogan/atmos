Here are some things that need doing - in the opinion of MC
If you are bored, why not checkout a fresh branch, make some of these changes, and fix things?
If you are planning on doing any of these, add your name by the end of the list, so there is no overlap

-change all species.dat files to NEWSPEC format, then delete option from input_photochem.dat

-consider coding multiple photolysis species, so as not to included hardcoded assumptions as to the order on the reactions.rx table (should wait until Xsections work settles)

-make sure all interpolations on Xsection file are done correctly

-remove unnecessary files from version control and update .gitingore

-standardize the file units on the read statements in PhotoMain.f (and propogate through all read/writes)
