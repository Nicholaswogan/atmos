1075.4   = G, Gravity - Earth=980.7, Mars=373.0
1890.40  = FSCALE, Solar Flux Scaling - Earth=1.0, Mars=0.43
0.010    = ALB, Surface Albedo - Earth=0.25, Mars=0.215
1.1E6    = ZTROP, Height of the tropopause - typically Earth=11km, Mars=15km
0.00     = FAR       Ar partial pressure (took out of species.dat, so 0.0)
12.797E9 = R0    Radius of wasp12b (note: 1 bar value)
1.0000   = P0  = surface pressure of wasp12b assumed at 10 bar (given value in bars)
WASP12B  = PLANET  string naming the planet for extra changes (MARS is the only other option for the moment)
0.0      = TIMEGA - time in Ga, for modifying the solar flux
0        = IRESET
20       = msun
0        = IHZSCALE
11       = JTROP, Grid layer marking the tropopause height, depends on ZTROP and DELZ
1.2949E+07 = DELZ, Height of each atm layer - Earth=1.0E5, Mars=2.0E5 (cm)

-below here are not read in.  They are from Shawn's Planet.earth file but are handled differently here.

IHZSCALE = set to 1 to automatically scale FSCALE to the earth-equivalent flux based on the spectral type (msun)
(to use keep FSCALE as 1, set IHZSCALE to 1, then change your msun type; will use Kopparapu et al 2012 scalings)

choices for msun (these numbers are from photgrid.f)
      msun = 12    !Gj 581 from Lucianne
      msun = 13    !high resolution solar data from ATLAS1/3 (Thullier et al 2004)
      msun = 14    !kevin's data from photo.dat
      msun = 15    !AD Leo from VPL climate DB
      msun = 16    !AD LEO from VPL website
      msun = 17    !T3200.dat
      msun = 18    !K2V
      msun = 19    !F2V
      msun = 76    !GJ876
      msun = 20    !G0V star for wasp12b
