***** SPECIES DEFINITIONS *****
*
*define LL,SL,TD, etc here
* Note - if you change the species order in LL or TD, you will need to change in.dist as well.
*
*LBOUND = lower boundary conditions
* 0 = constant deposition velocity (VDEP)
* 1 = constant mixing ratio
* 2 = constant upward flux (SGFLUX)
* 3 = constant vdep + vertically distributed upward flux  (uses both SGFLUX and DISTH)
*
*MBOUND - Upper boundary conditions
* 0 = CONSTANT EFFUSION VELOCITY (VEFF)  - (H and H2 set in code for molecular diffusion/diffusion limited flux)
* 1 = constant mixing ratio - never been used so would need testing
* 2 = CONSTANT FLUX (SMFLUX) (option for CO2/CO/0 in code)
