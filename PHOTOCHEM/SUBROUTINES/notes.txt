Rates.f has had format changes made to it, to read reactions.rx files that had been
formatted based off of the KIDA database(http://kida.obs.u-bordeaux1.fr/). Please look
at the png file: new_reactions.rx_formatting.png, which is in the subroutine help folder.
Reactions.rx now needs a header that matches the header in the .png file and the new
formatting rules are in rates.f
