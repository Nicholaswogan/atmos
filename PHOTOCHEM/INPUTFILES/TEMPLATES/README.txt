Archean+haze
Archean Earth atmosphere with solar constant at 2.7 Ga. This template forms a hydrocarbon haze. Decreasing the CH4/CO2 ratio will make the haze thinner; the opposite will happen if this ratio increases. 
392 reactions. 
76 chemical species.
Example publications: Zerkle et al. 2012; Arney et al. 2016, 2017

Archean+lowhaze
Archean Earth atmosphere with solar constant at 2.7 Ga. This template forms a very thin hydrocarbon haze. Decreasing the CH4/CO2 ratio will make the haze thinner; the opposite will happen if this ratio increases. 
392 reactions. 
76 chemical species. 
Example publications: Zerkle et al. 2012; Arney et al. 2016, 2017

ArcheanSORG+haze
Archean Earth atmosphere with organic sulfur species with solar constant at 2.7 Ga. This template forms a very thin hydrocarbon haze. Decreasing the CH4/CO2 ratio will make the haze thinner; the opposite will happen if this ratio increases. 
403 reactions. 
79 chemical species. 
Example publications: Arney et al. 2018

Archean_ModernEarthBCs
A template based on the Archean template set up to simulate the modern Earth atmosphere. 
492 reactions. 
76 chemical species.

high_O2_templates 
A set of templates that simulate planets with highly oxygenated atmospheres. Templates include atmospheres with 0.2 bar, 1 bar, and 10 bars of O2 for wet and desiccated atmospheres around the sun and GJ876. The template in the top level folder is the 10 bar, dry, O2 planet around GJ876. Based off of a modern Earth template.
232 reactions.
50 chemical species.
Example publications:  Schwieterman et al 2016; Meadows et al. 2018

Mars
A template that simulates Mars. Includes chlorine chemistry. 
344 reactions.
76 chemical species. 
Example publications:
